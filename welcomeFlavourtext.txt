Welcome to HangKat!
Meet LongKat - she's in a predicament (to say the least).
Diana, her mortal enemy, has framed her for the murder of 
Dapply Appley, the little brown rat! Thus, LongKat has 
used her omniscience (for she is the true Merlin) and 
omnipotence to alert you of her whereabouts. As her bestie 
Demima Duddle-Puck, you mutually pinky-promised her to help 
one another in times like this. But you're stuck - there's 
a locked door in between you and LongKat. It's asking for 
a password...
